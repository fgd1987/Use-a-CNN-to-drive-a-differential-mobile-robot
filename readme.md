# About  
This is a solution to the [2019 RVSS workshop](https://www.roboticvision.org/rvss2019/) finished by me and @Josh Newans,engineer who works in Newcastle.  
We use a classification method to train a shallow CNN model and deploy it on a mobile-robot, which enables the robot to drive along the white-green lane with gaps. Before that, we manually drive the robot along the lane and collect for more than 600 images.
